# Advanced Security Features Implementation
**Phase 1, Task 2: Advanced Security Features (#68)**

## Overview

I have successfully implemented a comprehensive security system for learner10x.com that provides enterprise-grade protection against various security threats. The implementation includes multiple layers of security controls that work together to protect the application.

## Implemented Security Modules

### 1. Security Headers Module (`src/lib/security/headers.ts`)

**Purpose**: Implements comprehensive HTTP security headers to protect against various web vulnerabilities.

**Features**:
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Prevents XSS attacks by controlling resource loading
- **HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)**: Enforces HTTPS connections
- **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents clickjacking attacks
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME type sniffing
- **Referrer Policy**: Controls referrer information leakage
- **Permissions Policy**: Controls browser feature access

**Key Security Headers Applied**:
```typescript
'Content-Security-Policy': "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'..."
'Strict-Transport-Security': 'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload'
'X-Frame-Options': 'DENY'
'X-Content-Type-Options': 'nosniff'
'Referrer-Policy': 'strict-origin-when-cross-origin'
```

### 2. Rate Limiting Module (`src/lib/security/rateLimit.ts`)

**Purpose**: Prevents abuse and DoS attacks by limiting request frequency.

**Features**:
- **IP-based rate limiting**: Tracks requests per IP address
- **Sliding window algorithm**: More accurate than fixed windows
- **Configurable limits**: Customizable rate limits per endpoint
- **Memory-efficient storage**: Uses Map with automatic cleanup
- **Rate limit headers**: Provides client feedback on limits

**Configuration**:
- Default: 1000 requests per 15 minutes per IP
- Automatic cleanup of expired entries
- Headers: `X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, `X-RateLimit-Reset`

### 3. CSRF Protection Module (`src/lib/security/csrf.ts`)

**Purpose**: Prevents Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.

**Features**:
- **Token-based protection**: Validates CSRF tokens for state-changing requests
- **Double submit cookies**: Uses both header and cookie validation
- **Origin validation**: Checks request origin against allowed origins
- **Configurable exclusions**: Allows excluding specific paths
- **Secure token generation**: Uses cryptographically secure random tokens

**Protection Methods**:
- CSRF token validation for POST/PUT/DELETE/PATCH requests
- Origin header validation
- Referer header validation as fallback

### 4. Request Sanitization Module (`src/lib/security/sanitization.ts`)

**Purpose**: Detects and prevents various injection attacks.

**Features**:
- **XSS Prevention**: Detects and blocks script injection attempts
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Identifies SQL injection patterns
- **Path Traversal Prevention**: Blocks directory traversal attempts
- **Command Injection Prevention**: Detects command injection patterns
- **File Upload Validation**: Validates file types and names
- **Input Sanitization**: Cleans malicious input while preserving functionality

**Threat Detection Patterns**:
- XSS: `<script>`, `javascript:`, `vbscript:`, event handlers
- SQL Injection: `UNION SELECT`, `DROP TABLE`, SQL keywords
- Path Traversal: `../`, `..\\`, encoded variations
- Command Injection: `|`, `&`, `;`, system commands

### 5. Threat Detection Module (`src/lib/security/threatDetection.ts`)

**Purpose**: Advanced behavioral analysis and anomaly detection.

**Features**:
- **Bot Detection**: Identifies automated requests and crawlers
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Detects suspicious request patterns
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies unusual request characteristics
- **Risk Scoring**: Assigns threat scores based on multiple factors
- **Threat Classification**: Categorizes threats as LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH
- **Actionable Recommendations**: Provides security recommendations

**Detection Capabilities**:
- Malicious user agents (sqlmap, nikto, nmap, etc.)
- Missing browser headers
- Suspicious file extensions in URLs
- Encoded bypass attempts
- Excessive parameters
- Unusual HTTP methods

### 6. Security Logging Module (`src/lib/security/logging.ts`)

**Purpose**: Comprehensive security event logging and alerting.

**Features**:
- **Structured Logging**: JSON-formatted security events
- **Real-time Alerting**: Automatic alerts for security incidents
- **Event Tracking**: In-memory tracking for pattern analysis
- **Severity Classification**: Events classified by severity level
- **Statistics Generation**: Security metrics and analytics
- **Edge Runtime Compatible**: Works in Next.js Edge Runtime

**Event Types Logged**:
- Request processing events
- Rate limit violations
- CSRF validation failures
- Malicious request detection
- High/medium threat detection
- Security middleware errors

### 7. Security Middleware (`src/middleware.ts`)

**Purpose**: Orchestrates all security modules in a unified middleware layer.

**Features**:
- **Layered Security**: Applies multiple security checks in sequence
- **Performance Monitoring**: Tracks security processing time
- **Graceful Error Handling**: Continues operation even if individual modules fail
- **Configurable Security Levels**: Adjustable security settings
- **Request Blocking**: Automatically blocks high-risk requests

**Security Flow**:
1. Apply security headers
2. Rate limiting check
3. CSRF protection (for state-changing requests)
4. Request sanitization
5. Threat detection analysis
6. Security event logging

### 8. Security API Endpoint (`src/app/api/security/route.ts`)

**Purpose**: Provides security monitoring and testing capabilities.

**Features**:
- **Security Status Monitoring**: Real-time security system status
- **Security Testing**: Built-in security feature testing
- **Configuration Management**: Dynamic security configuration updates
- **Statistics API**: Security metrics and analytics
- **Health Checks**: Security system health monitoring

**API Endpoints**:
- `GET /api/security` - Security status and statistics
- `POST /api/security/test` - Test security features
- `PUT /api/security/config` - Update security configuration

## Security Implementation Highlights

### 1. **Multi-Layered Defense**

### Test Evidence
During testing, the system successfully detected and blocked a request with:
- SQL injection patterns
- Command injection patterns
- Returned appropriate "Request blocked due to security policy" response
- Logged the security event with HIGH severity

## Configuration

The security system is highly configurable with sensible defaults:

```typescript
// Rate Limiting
windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
max: 1000, // requests per window

// CSRF Protection
enabled: true,
excludePaths: ['/api/health', '/api/public'],

// Threat Detection
enableBotDetection: true,
enableAnomalyDetection: true,
enableBehavioralAnalysis: true,

// Security Logging
enableConsoleLogging: true,
enableAlerts: true,
```
