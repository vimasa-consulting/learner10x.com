/**
 * Data Migration Procedures for learner10x.com
 * 
 * This file provides a step-by-step guide for executing data migration
 * as part of Phase 1, Task 1.7: Data Migration & Integration Strategy (#60).
 * The goal is to ensure a structured and repeatable process for migrating data
 * from source systems to the target platform with minimal disruption.
 */

/**
 * Migration Procedure Overview
 * 
 * The migration process follows these high-level phases:
 * 1. Preparation: Setting up tools, backups, and environments.
 * 2. Extraction: Retrieving data from source systems.
 * 3. Transformation: Converting data to match the target schema.
 * 4. Loading: Importing transformed data into the target system.
 * 5. Validation: Verifying the migrated data for accuracy and completeness.
 * 6. Finalization: Completing the migration with documentation and cleanup.
 */

/**
 * Detailed Migration Steps
 */

/**
 * Step 1: Preparation
 * 
 * Objective: Ensure all prerequisites are in place before migration begins.
 * 
 * Actions:
 * - 1.1: Identify source and target systems, confirming access credentials and connectivity.
 * - 1.2: Set up migration tools and scripts (e.g., ETL tools, custom scripts).
 * - 1.3: Create full backups of source data to prevent data loss.
 * - 1.4: Prepare staging environment for transformation and testing.
 * - 1.5: Document migration plan, including timeline, roles, and rollback strategy.
 * 
 * Checklist:
 * - [ ] Source and target systems accessible.
 * - [ ] Migration tools installed and configured.
 * - [ ] Backups completed and verified.
 * - [ ] Staging environment ready.
 * - [ ] Migration plan documented.
 */

/**
 * Step 2: Extraction
 * 
 * Objective: Retrieve data from source systems efficiently.
 * 
 * Actions:
 * - 2.1: Execute extraction scripts to pull data from source databases, APIs, or files.
 * - 2.2: Log extraction details, including record counts and timestamps.
 * - 2.3: Store extracted data securely in the staging environment.
 * - 2.4: Handle extraction errors by retrying failed operations or logging for manual review.
 * 
 * Checklist:
 * - [ ] Extraction scripts executed successfully.
 * - [ ] Record counts match expected numbers.
 * - [ ] Extracted data stored in staging area.
 * - [ ] Extraction errors resolved or documented.
 */

/**
 * Step 3: Transformation
 * 
 * Objective: Convert extracted data to match the target system's schema.
 * 
 * Actions:
 * - 3.1: Apply data mapping rules to transform fields (e.g., renaming, reformatting).
 * - 3.2: Perform data cleansing (e.g., removing duplicates, normalizing values).
 * - 3.3: Handle data type conversions and resolve inconsistencies.
 * - 3.4: Log transformation results, noting any data loss or issues.
 * 
 * Checklist:
 * - [ ] Data mapping rules applied.
 * - [ ] Data cleansing completed.
 * - [ ] Data type conversions handled.
 * - [ ] Transformation logs reviewed for issues.
 */

/**
 * Step 4: Loading
 * 
 * Objective: Import transformed data into the target system.
 * 
 * Actions:
 * - 4.1: Execute loading scripts to insert data into target database or storage.
 * - 4.2: Use batch processing for large datasets to optimize performance.
 * - 4.3: Monitor loading progress and handle errors (e.g., constraint violations).
 * - 4.4: Log loading statistics, including success and failure rates.
 * 
 * Checklist:
 * - [ ] Loading scripts executed.
 * - [ ] Batch processing completed for large datasets.
 * - [ ] Loading errors addressed.
 * - [ ] Loading statistics logged.
 */

/**
 * Step 5: Validation
 * 
 * Objective: Verify the accuracy, completeness, and consistency of migrated data.
 * 
 * Actions:
 * - 5.1: Run validation tests using scripts from 'validation.ts' (completeness, accuracy, consistency).
 * - 5.2: Compare checksums or hash values of critical data between source and target.
 * - 5.3: Address validation failures by re-running specific migration steps or manual corrections.
 * - 5.4: Document validation results for audit purposes.
 * 
 * Checklist:
 * - [ ] Validation tests executed.
 * - [ ] Checksums or hashes verified.
 * - [ ] Validation failures resolved.
 * - [ ] Validation results documented.
 */

/**
 * Step 6: Finalization
 * 
 * Objective: Complete the migration process with proper documentation and cleanup.
 * 
 * Actions:
 * - 6.1: Confirm migration success with stakeholders.
 * - 6.2: Update system documentation to reflect new data structures.
 * - 6.3: Clean up temporary files and staging data.
 * - 6.4: Decommission source systems if no longer needed, after final backup.
 * - 6.5: Communicate migration completion to relevant teams.
 * 
 * Checklist:
 * - [ ] Migration success confirmed.
 * - [ ] Documentation updated.
 * - [ ] Temporary data cleaned up.
 * - [ ] Source systems decommissioned or backed up.
 * - [ ] Completion communicated.
 */

/**
 * Rollback Procedures
 * 
 * Objective: Define steps to revert to the original state if migration fails.
 * 
 * Actions:
 * - R1: Stop ongoing migration processes immediately upon detecting critical failure.
 * - R2: Restore target system to pre-migration state using backups.
 * - R3: Revert any changes made to source systems during migration.
 * - R4: Document the cause of failure and lessons learned.
 * - R5: Plan re-migration with corrected approach after root cause analysis.
 * 
 * Checklist:
 * - [ ] Migration processes stopped.
 * - [ ] Target system restored.
 * - [ ] Source system changes reverted.
 * - [ ] Failure documented.
 * - [ ] Re-migration planned.

/**
 * Migration Procedure Execution Function
 * 
 * This function can be used to log progress through each step of the migration procedure.
 * @param step The step number or identifier
 * @param action The specific action being performed
 * @param status The status of the action (e.g., 'started', 'completed', 'failed')
 * @returns A formatted log message
 */
export function logMigrationStep(step: string, action: string, status: string): string {
  const timestamp = new Date().toISOString();

}

/**
 * Example Usage
 * 
 * console.log(logMigrationStep('1.1', 'Identify source and target systems', 'started'));
 * // Output: [2025-07-08T10:30:00.000Z] Migration Step 1.1 - Action: Identify source and target systems - Status: started
 */

/**
 * Next Steps for Migration Procedures
 * 
 * - Customize checklists based on specific data sources and target systems for learner10x.com.
 * - Develop detailed scripts for extraction, transformation, and loading processes.
 * - Test migration procedures in a sandbox environment before full execution.
 * - Train team members on migration and rollback procedures.
 * - Schedule migration during a low-usage window to minimize impact.
