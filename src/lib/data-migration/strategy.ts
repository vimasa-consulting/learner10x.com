/**
 * Data Migration & Integration Strategy for learner10x.com
 * 
 * This file outlines the strategy for data migration and integration as part of Phase 1, Task 1.7 (#60).
 * The goal is to ensure seamless data migration from existing systems (if any) to the new platform
 * and to establish a robust integration architecture for external systems.
 */

/**
 * Data Migration Strategy
 * 
 * 1. Assessment of Current Data Structure:
 *    - Identify existing data sources (e.g., legacy databases, flat files, APIs).
 *    - Document schema, volume, and data quality issues.
 *    - Determine data dependencies and relationships.
 * 
 * 2. Migration Strategy Design:
 *    - Define migration approach (e.g., big bang, phased, parallel run).
 *    - Plan for data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL processes).
 *    - Address data cleansing and deduplication needs.
 * 
 * 3. Data Mapping:
 *    - Map source data fields to target schema in the new system.
 *    - Handle data type conversions and format inconsistencies.
 *    - Document mapping rules for transparency and future reference.
 * 
 * 4. Migration Testing Plan:
 *    - Test migration with sample data to validate mappings and transformations.
 *    - Perform full migration dry runs to identify potential issues.
 *    - Establish rollback procedures in case of migration failure.
 */

/**
 * Integration Architecture
 * 
 * 1. External System Integration:
 *    - Identify external systems for integration (e.g., payment gateways, analytics tools).
 *    - Define integration points and methods (e.g., REST APIs, webhooks, batch processing).
 *    - Ensure security through authentication and encryption for data exchange.
 * 
 * 2. API Architecture Design:
 *    - Develop RESTful API endpoints for internal and external data interactions.
 *    - Implement versioning to manage API evolution.
 *    - Use API gateways for traffic management, monitoring, and security.
 * 
 * 3. Data Synchronization:
 *    - Establish sync mechanisms (e.g., real-time, scheduled batch updates).
 *    - Handle conflict resolution for data updates across systems.
 *    - Monitor sync performance and latency issues.
 * 
 * 4. Error Handling and Recovery:
 *    - Implement robust error logging for integration failures.
 *    - Design retry mechanisms for transient failures.
 *    - Set up alerts for critical integration issues.
 */

/**
 * Data Validation and Integrity
 * 
 * 1. Validation Tests:
 *    - Create automated scripts to validate data post-migration.
 *    - Check for data completeness, accuracy, and consistency.
 * 
 * 2. Integrity Checks:
 *    - Implement constraints and triggers to maintain referential integrity.
 *    - Use checksums or hash validations for critical data.
 * 
 * 3. Quality Monitoring:
 *    - Set up dashboards for ongoing data quality metrics.
 *    - Schedule periodic data audits to detect anomalies.
 * 
 * 4. Rollback Procedures:
 *    - Document steps to revert to original data state if migration fails.
 *    - Maintain backups of source data before migration begins.
 */

/**
 * Deliverables for Task 1.7
 * 
 * - Data Migration Strategy Document: Detailed plan for assessing, mapping, and migrating data.
 * - Integration Architecture Design: Blueprint for connecting with external systems.
 * - Data Validation Tests: Scripts and procedures to ensure migrated data accuracy.
 * - Migration Procedures: Step-by-step guide for executing the migration.
 * - Data Integrity Monitoring: Tools and processes to maintain data quality post-migration.
 * - Comprehensive Documentation: All aspects of the strategy and implementation recorded.
 */

/**
 * Next Steps
 * 
 * - Begin assessment of current data structures and sources.
 * - Develop detailed data mapping documents.
 * - Create migration scripts and test with sample data.
 * - Design and implement API endpoints for integrations.
 * - Set up validation and monitoring tools for data integrity.
